# RSMAN
Source code for NAACL 2022 paper: Relation-Specific Attentions over Entity Mentions for Enhanced Document-Level Relation Extraction
## Introduction
This is the implementation of the **RSMAN** (**R**elation-**S**pecific **M**ention **A**ttention **N**etwork) with [**SSAN**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10249) as the backbone model. **RSMAN** is easy to be plugged into other different backbone models to enhance them and here we take **SSAN** for example. Part of the code is borrowed from https://github.com/BenfengXu/SSAN, and we really appreciate it.
